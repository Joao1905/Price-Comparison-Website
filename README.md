# Price-Comparison-Website
Turns out you can do a lot of things with a java website and a python crawler :)

### Best Price Comparison Website, Dec. 2019
Created a website that scrapes the price of computer parts from 4 Brazilian shops and displays 180-day lowest price charts. Features registration and lead tracking per product. This went online for some months, and I've used cron jobs to keep the crawlers running everyday. I've also done DNS and SSL configurations manually. The focus was not the front end, but the website looks just fine (Java EE, Glassfish 4, Python, Scrapy, MySQL, *Nix Crontab, Google Cloud, Git, DNS and SSL, Materialize CSS)

PS: If anyone wants to use the code, the crawlers might need some update. Don't forget to update MYSQL connection inputs as well.\
PS2: Interesting front and back-end files are inside Trace/Trace-war/web/ and Trace/Trace-war/src/java/ respectively.
